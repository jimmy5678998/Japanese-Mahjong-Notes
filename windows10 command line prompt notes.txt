Using cmd as example
why we should use command line?
1. It is much faster than GUI
2. Some programs are GUI excluded, and only manipulated with command lines.

Try to research with command /? for cmd command before type in google.

some tips:
tab button: autocomplete the word so you don't need to type so many words(by alphabetical order)
up arrow/ down arrow: to search command history that you have used before
home button/ end button: to the first/last character of sentence
. : current directory
.. : parent directory
/a : shows all files(including hidden files)
/s : modifies the treatment of string after /c or /k, meaning copy all subdirectories
/? : help option for brief review of the command
* : to choose only some specific files(e.g. dir *.png)
"": quoating the absolute path
% : quoating the words to make it variable
+ : adding some attributes to something
- : deleting some attributes to something
> : create/ overriding file
>> : appends file
---
command list:

cd = change directory (e.g. cd Desktop\Videos, cd ../..(meaning back to the parent directory and then back one more parent directory))

dir = check all of the folders and files in the directory( e.g dir (Desired path) is going to show the directory of the path without navigating to there.)

cls = clear screen

echo = print some messages, also to set whether giving message feedback or not

copy = copy files(no folders),format is like (copy desiredfile.format destination)

xcopy = copy the files and the folder hierarchies

robocopy = copy the files and the folder hierarchies, will retry when there is error

move = move files to another directory, format is like (move desiredfile destination)

rename = rename files, format is like (rename desiredfile newname)

del = delete files(not for directory)

color = change color of your words and background. type in two digit(e.g.7B) to change, type in color only will reset the setting

mkdir = make directory

rmdir = remove directory

type = read the content of txt file

path = shows all the path that windows have set

attrib =  displays or changes the file attributes for a file or folder

set = setup environmental variables, using it singly will cause to print out all environmental variables

fc = file comparision

wmic = an acronym for Windows Management Instrumentation Command. Replaced now and not use commonly anymore

chkdsk = checks a disk and displays a status report

ipconfig = checking ip config of the computer

examples:
opening a file in current directory: 
just type the name of the file following with the format(.xxx)

open file with space:
use absolute path to open after using path variable

how to call out python:
type in python; if you want to exit, type exit()

getting drive name:
type"wmic logicaldisk get name"

change drive:
type the drive letter with colon (e.g. F:)

why files are hidden:
developers don't want you to mess with them, so just stay away from the hidden files and hentais

make a txt file with some words(overwriting files):
echo desiredwordings > name.txt

save command content to txt file(e.g. dir in this case):
dir > name.txt
